1-1/2 cups White Urad Dal (Split)
1 teaspoon Methi Seeds (Fenugreek Seeds)
Salt , to taste ","To begin making the Foxtail Millet Idli Recipe, we will wash and soak the millets in water in a separately bowl and urad dal along with methi seeds with enough water in another bowl overnight or keep soaked for at least 8 hours. Soak each of them separately.

To make the batter, drain the excess water soaked millets and urad dal.

Blend the urad dal along with just enough water to make a thick and very smooth batter.

Transfer the batter to a large bowl in which we will set it aside for fermentation along with ground millet.

Next blend the foxtail millet with just enough water to make a smooth batter.

Add this to the urad dal batter, add 2 teaspoons of salt and stir well to combine.

Ferment the batter for 5 to 6 hours or overnight.

Once the batter is fermented, gently stir and be careful to not release the air pockets.

You can make regular sized idlis or also use the mini idli stand. Grease the idli molds with a little oil and spoon the foxtail millet idli batter into the molds.

Prepare the idli steamer with a little water in the bottom.

Place the filled idli racks in the steamer. Place the steamer on high heat and steam the idli’s for 10 minutes.

After 10 minutes of steaming, turn off the heat. Open the steamer and insert a knife or a pick to test whether the idli's are cooked. If nothing sticks then the idlis are perfectly steamed.

Now you can remove the Foxtail millet idli from the steamer. Have a small bowl filled with water.

Dip a spoon in the water and then scoop the ragi idli out starting from the edges. Dipping the spoon in water helps in the easy removal of idli from the plates.

The wholesome homemade pillow-soft foxtail millet idli is now ready to be served. 

Serve the Foxtail Millet Mini Idli Recipe along with Thakkali Vengayam Sambar, chutney to enjoy your morning breakfast.

Ghee ½  tsp","METHOD
Heat water in a bowl. 
Mix all the flours together. Keep adding water enough to make soft pliable dough. 
Knead for few minutes untill it turns sticky. Add ghee and knead again. 
Brush ghee over the kneaded dough and keep it aside covered in moist muslin cloth for 15-30 minutes. 
Make small balls of the dough
Dust the rolling base with little amount of flour and roll using the rolling pin.
If the chapati is not rolling properly,  take two parchment papers or rice papers and keep the rolling dough in between them and then roll on to the plastic sheet.
Heat a griddle
When the griddle becomes hot, transfer the roti on it. Squeeze off excess water from the muslin cloth and smear water over the roti including the edges with the cloth. Do not pour water on roti. The roti must become moist all over.  By now the roti firms up from the centre. 
Flip the roti to the other side. Repeat dampening and then cover it. 
When the roti is cooked, remove from griddle and rub ½ tsp ghee over it. 
Serve hot with curries or vegetables.

Here are the 4 simple steps to do oil pulling:

Measure one tablespoon of oil, such as coconut, sesame or olive oil.
Swish it around in your mouth for 15–20 minutes, being careful not to swallow any.
Spit the oil into a trash can once you’re done. Avoid spitting it into the sink or toilet, as this can cause a buildup of oil, which may lead to clogging.
Rinse your mouth well using water before eating or drinking anything.
Repeat these steps a few times per week or up to three times daily. You may also want to work your way up, starting with swishing for just 5 minutes and increasing the duration until you’re able to do it for a full 15–20 minutes.",https://www.youtube.com/embed/XVUaBDV64hU,,,1,Portion,"[""IND"",""USA""]",3,-1,3,-1,3,-1,3,-1,0,-1000,-1000,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,9,0,9,-1,-1,-1,-1,9,9,9,9,1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,3,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,1,1,-1,-1,-1,-1

2 cups of grated CAULIFLOWER
1 cup of freshly grated PARMESAN CHEESE
1 EGG beaten
PARCHMENT PAPER to line your baking sheet
and whatever PIZZA SAUCE and
PIZZA TOPPINGS you desire","How to Cook the A Cauliflower Crust Pizza Recipe:
Grate fresh cauliflower florets into granules resembling ""poprocks""
Heat the grated cauliflower in a skillet--don't add oil or water--use medium heat, not too hot. Stir until the cauliflower has dried out somewhat, it won't dry completely, but the dryer the better. Heat at least 10 minutes, just enough to evaporate the moisture, not enough to color or cook down.
Remove skillet from burner and set aside to allow cauliflower to slightly cool.
In a bowl, beat 1 egg.
Add grated Parmesan cheese to the egg. You can substitute, asiago or romano cheeses, just be sure you use a hard cheese for best results.
Add the cauliflower to the bowl and mix well with the egg and cheese and form into a ball.
Spread parchment paper onto a baking sheet. DEFINITELY USE PARCHMENT PAPER, otherwise your crust may tear when you try to pick it up (and also be sure not to mix up parchment paper with wax paper!)
Place the balled cauliflower and cheese onto the parchment paper and spread out into a pizza shape about ¼ inch thick.  The crust will be about 10"" across.
Do not make the edges of the crust too thin; keep the size of the crust uniform for even cooking. The cauliflower will darken quite rapidly around the edges if too thin.
Place crust into an oven preheated to 400 degrees Fahrenheit and cook approx. 15-20 minutes until the crust has colored and firmed up.
Remove cauliflower pizza crust from the oven and top with your favorite pizza sauce. Use a marinara sauce, pesto, white sauce, or whatever. Top with your favorite pizza toppings.
Return pizza to the oven and continue to cook at 400 F for about 10 minutes until the toppings are done, watch the edges of the cauliflower crust; the edges will darken too much if overcooked.
Remove the pizza from the oven and set on a cooling rack -or don't- this step isn't make or break.
And that's it.

When the griddle becomes hot, transfer the roti on it. Squeeze off excess water from the muslin cloth and smear water over the roti including the edges with the cloth. Do not pour water on roti. The roti must become moist all over.  By now the roti firms up from the centre. 
Flip the roti to the other side. Repeat dampening and then cover it. 
When the roti is cooked, remove from griddle and rub ½ tsp ghee over it. 
Serve hot with curries or vegetables.

","1. Preheat the oven to 180 Celsius / 356 Fahrenheit.
2. Mix all dry ingredients in another bowl - coconut flour, psyllium husk powder, xanthan gum and salt. Make sure there are no lumps.
3. Add the wet ingredients - hot water, yogurt, melted coconut oil or olive oil - and stir together until a dough forms.
4. Form a dough ball and let it sit for a few minutes until the coconut flour and the psyllium have absorbed all the moisture and the dough is not sticky.
5. Cut the dough into 6 pieces and roll them out between two sheets of parchment paper into long flatbreads, about ½ cm thick. Place on an upturned  baking sheet and remove the top parchment. Optional: sprinkle with sesame seeds and/or nigella seeds.
Bake for 12-15 minutes or until browned (baking time will depend on how thick your flatbreads are). If large air bubbles form, pierce with a fork during baking.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            6. If necessary, rotate the baking sheet so the flatbreads brown equally and/or turn on the grill/broiler at the end to ensure they crisp and brown on top.             7. Top with melted butter, olive oil or coconut oil, sprinkle with more salt and chopped parsley or coriander/cilantro leaves before serving.

3. Take out the mixture in a bowl, add the melted oil and carom seeds to it. Mix well.
4. Slowly add half the water to it. The ingredients will start binding with each other; add more only if you think the batter is very dry and not coming together. 5. The water needs to be hot, not boiling.
6. I will not be able to tell you the exact amount of water, as different brands of Psyllium husk will react differently.
7. Now let the dough rest for five to seven minutes. Heat the griddle or non-stick pan on which you intent to cook the chapati.
8. I smeared the hot plate or tawa with half the ghee and got it ready.

10. Place one ball between the sheets of paper and lightly press with a rolling pin or belan. Do not apply too much pressure or the batter will stick to the paper.
11.Now you can either lift the bread with a flat spoon or with your hands and place it on the hot plate.
12. Keep the heat high and let it get lightly golden on one side before you turn it.
13. Turn a few times more, with a flat spoon, the bread should be cooked from all sides and should be crisp. Don’t worry it does not stick to the plate, because of the oil in it.

• 1 ½  - 2 tsp Himalayan pink salt (plus more to taste)
• 1 small beet (finely shredded)
• 3 whole carrots (finely shredded) (optional)
• 3 Tbsp fresh ginger (shredded / grated)
• 3 Tbsp fresh turmeric (shredded / grated)
• 4 cloves garlic (finely minced)
","1. Sterilize glass jars. Do so easily by pouring boiling water over clean jars and lids and drying completely. Let come back to room temperature before adding ingredients.
2. Add finely grated cabbage to a large mixing bowl and top with 1 ½ teaspoons sea salt. Wash hands thoroughly and massage cabbage for ten minutes. The cabbage should start softening, shrinking in size, and releasing water. Continue massaging until it happens.
3. Add shredded beet, carrot, ginger, turmeric, and garlic and massage once more with clean hands for 4-5 minutes until thoroughly combined. Then taste test and adjust flavor, adding more salt for saltiness, grated ginger for more zing, or garlic for more intense garlic flavor.
4. Use your clean hands to put the sauerkraut mixture into your sterilized jars and press down firmly to pack. There should be enough liquid from the massaging to rise up and cover the vegetables. If this doesn’t happen, top with filtered water until covered (it is unlikely that you will need to add water).
5. Also, make sure there is plenty of room (about 1 ½ inches) between the contents and the lid so it has room to expand. Seal with a lid and set on the counter where there’s not much direct sun exposure or in a cabinet. The ideal temperature for fermentation is above 65 degrees F (18 C), so try to keep your environment on the warmer side to encourage proper fermentation.
6. Fermentation can happen as quickly as 24 hours if your space is hot, or it can take as long as 2 weeks, (again, depending on the environment). 
7. During this fermentation process, open your jars once per day to release air (you should feel pressure release and see air bubbles when you open the jars). Press down with a sterilized object such as a spoon or the bottom of a drinking glass to ensure that the vegetables are still completely covered in the liquid. Doing so helps encourage proper fermentation.
8. The longer it sits and ferments, the tangier it will become, so sample occasionally with a clean utensil to test and see if it is at the right stage for you. Once it has reached the desired tanginess, cover securely and transfer to the fridge, where it should keep at least 3 months and up to 6 months. When serving, don’t double dip to avoid contamination.

• ¾ teaspoon salt, to taste
• ¼ teaspoon ground cumin
• Pinch of smoked paprika, for garnish
","1. Preheat the oven to 450*F  with a rack in the upper third of the oven. Line a large, rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper to prevent the eggplant from sticking to the pan. Halve the eggplants lengthwise and brush the cut sides lightly with olive oil. Place them in the prepared pan with the halved sides down.
2. Roast the eggplant until the interior is very tender throughout and the skin is collapsing, about 35 to 40 minutes. Set the eggplant aside to cool for a few minutes. Flip the eggplants over and scoop out the flesh with a large spoon, leaving the skin behind.
3. Place a mesh strainer over a mixing bowl, then transfer the flesh to the strainer and discard the skins. Pick out any stray bits of eggplant skin and discard. You want to remove as much moisture from the eggplant here as possible, so let the eggplant rest for a few minutes and shake/stir the eggplant to release some more moisture.
4. Discard all of the eggplant drippings, drain and wipe out the bowl, and dump the eggplant into the bowl. Add the garlic and lemon juice to the eggplant and stir vigorously with a fork until eggplant breaks down. Add the tahini to the bowl and stir until it’s incorporated. While stirring, slowly drizzle in the olive oil. Continue stirring until the mixture is pale and creamy, and use your fork to break up any particularly long strings of eggplant.
5. Stir in the parsley, salt and cumin. Season to taste with more salt (and more lemon juice, if you’d like a more tart flavor.
6.Transfer the baba ganoush to a serving bowl and lightly drizzle olive oil on top. Lastly, sprinkle parsley and smoked paprika on top. Serve with accompaniments of your choice.

•        1 tbsp vegetable oil
•        1/2 tsp black mustard seeds 
•        1/2 red onion, cut in half again (like a quartered orange) and thinly sliced

•        2 long green chillies, cut into half lengthwise and deseeded, optional

•        150g firm-fleshed white fish , cut into 3cm / 1.25"" cubes

","1.        Place Curry Paste ingredients in a tall jug or milkshake container (something that fits the head of a blender stick) then blitz on high for 5 to 10 seconds until the onion is pureed. Add more water if needed to make it puree.
2.        Heat oil over medium heat in a large pot. Add black mustard seeds and let them sizzle for 30 seconds - careful, they might pop!
3.        Add red onion and cook for 3 minutes until edges start to tinge with gold.
4.        Add curry paste and cook for 3 minutes - to evaporate water, make spices bloom and cook garlic & ginger.
5.        Turn heat up to medium high. Add tomato paste and tomato pulp, cook for 2 minutes.
6.        Add water, coconut milk, sugar, salt and chilli powder if using. Stir, then bring to simmer, low heat so it's bubbling gently.
7.        Simmer for 2 minutes, add tomato and green chilli.
8.        Simmer for another 3 minutes, stirring every now and then - sauce should be thickened (not watery), it gets looser again when fish is added (because fish will drop some juices = even more flavour!).
9.        Add fish, stir, cook for 3 to 4 minutes until fish easily flakes.
10.        Remove from stove and transfer to serving bowl. Garnish with coriander/cilantro and fresh green chillies if desired.

•        1/4 cup Almond flour
•        ¼ tsp sea salt
•       1  tbsp ghee
•        ½ tsp vanilla extract
For Filing
•        2 cloves Garlic, grated
•        1/4 cup grams Broccoli, cut to florets
•        1 Red Bell pepper 
•        1 Tomato, finely chopped

•        1 teaspoon Red Chilli flakes
•        1/4 cup Cheddar cheese
•        1 tsp Extra Virgin Olive Oil 
","For the crust of the Quiche
1.        Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (177 degrees C). Line the bottom of a 9 in (23 cm) round pie pan with parchment paper, or grease well.
2.        In a large bowl, mix together the almond flour, erythritol (if using), and sea salt.
3.        Stir in the melted ghee, until well combined. (If using vanilla, stir that into the melted ghee before adding to the dry ingredients.) The ""dough"" will be dry and crumbly. Just keep mixing, pressing and stirring, until it's uniform and there is no almond flour powder left. (Alternatively, you can use a food processor to mix it all together.)
4.        Press the dough into the bottom of the prepared pan. You can flute the edges of desired; if it crumbles when doing this, just press it back together. Carefully poke holes in the surface using a fork to prevent bubbling.
5.        Bake for 10-12 minutes, until lightly golden
For the Filling
6.        Heat a tablespoon of olive oil in a wok; stir fry the red bell peppers and the garlic until the peppers are roasted and lightly soft. Next add in the half way while the peppers are roasting. Stir fry the broccoli until just about tender, but still firm. 
7.        Now we will make the white sauce for the quiche; whisk together bechamel sauce, sun dried tomatoes, nutmeg, red chilli flakes and salt in a large bowl until smooth. Once the pie shell has been bakes until golden, remove from the oven and pour white sauce filling into the pre baked pie shell. Add in broccoli, then sprinkle with cheeses on the top.
8.        Place the Broccoli Quiche back into the oven and bake until the quiche custard is ser and the cheese has a golden crust on the top. The centre will be shaky but it will continue to set as the quiche cools.
9.        Once done, remove from the oven. Serve Broccoli Cheddar Quiche hot.

¼ teaspoon black pepper","1. Whisk the eggs with the water until you achieve a uniform mixture.
2. Add the chopped dill and whisk until incorporated. I usually use scissors to cut any fine herbs, and it makes the job SO much faster.

3. Chop your veggies. Depending on what way you plan to 'finish' off your omelette (read the section below), you may need smaller pieces vs. larger.
4. Heat up the butter in a large non-stick frying pan/skillet. For a single-serve omelette then a 6-inch pan will be more than enough. 5. For two servings, then between an 8-10-inch pan.
6. Finely dice your onion and add it to the pan. Lightly saute on medium heat for about a minute, then add in the remainder of the vegetables.
7. Saute the vegetables for just a few minutes, until they begin to soften. At this point, you could add some additional seasonings to the vegetables, if you prefer (like salt & pepper, cayenne, paprika, turmeric, etc.).
8. Reduce the heat to low and pour in the egg mixture. Allow it to sit for just a few seconds to firm up, give the pan a little shake to dispense the egg on top, and then using a small rubber spatula gently push/gently fold the egg away from the sides.
Tilt the pan slightly and allow excess egg to flow into the corners. This way all the uncooked eggs will move to the sides, and your omelette will cook faster. You want your omelette to be vibrant and fluffy but without overcooking the eggs.

As an optional step, you could place a lid over the omelette for a couple of minutes. This will allow the water in the egg mixture to steam up further and help cook the top of the eggs even faster.
Just before it's served, sprinkle with salt and pepper and then serve immediately. I usually shake the pan a bit to make sure the egg mixture is loose and then, holding a plate below the pan, tilt the pan and allow it to slowly slide onto the plate.",,,https://www.alphafoodie.com/how-to-make-a-veggie-omelette/#recipe-video,1,pc- 130g,"[""IND""]",6,-1,9,-1,9,-1,6,-1,1.4,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,9,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,9,9,9,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,9,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,6,6,-1,-1,-1,-1

2.	Heat 2 tablespoon of Sesame oil and add the gooseberries and saute in oil for couple of minutes. 
3.	Then, close the pan with a lid and allow the gooseberry to cook in low flame till it is soft.
4.	It usually takes around 10 minutes for the gooseberries to cook completely and become soft. 
5.	We can also boil the gooseberries in hot water till it is soft instead of sauteing in the oil. 
6.	We prefer sauteing process as she believes sauteing process helps the pickle to stay fresh and have longer shelf life.
7.	Now that the gooseberries are cooked, you can use a spoon or fork to split the gooseberry and discard the seeds.
8.	Now sauteed de-seeded gooseberries ready!
9.	Take the de-seeded Gooseberries in a mixer jar and grind it to a coarse paste. 
10.	I would recommend to use the Pulse mode for grinding and that way the pickle will not be so smooth. Its completely ok to have some chunks.
11.	Heat rest of oil and add mustard seeds and allow it to sputter. Then, add the asafoetida and turmeric powder.
12.	To the pan, then add the ground Gooseberry paste. Then, add the salt and red chilli powder and mix everything well. Adjust the salt and chili powder as per the sourness of the gooseberry.
13.	Cook the thokku for 5 mins in low flame. We can add more oil if the thokku is very dry. 
14.	Then finally add fenugreek powder and mix well and switch off the flame.

2.	Lightly coat a large nonstick skillet with butter, olive oil or coconut oil and place over medium heat. Once oil or butter is hot, drop about 1/4 cup of batter onto the skillet. It's important to cook until bubbles appear on top and the edges are well cooked.
3.	Flip cakes and cook until golden brown on underside, 2 minutes. If you find that the pancakes are browning too quickly then you need to lower your skillet heat a bit. I normally start on medium or medium low, then decrease to lower heat later so that my pancakes don't burn.
4.	Wipe skillet clean and repeat with more butter/oil and remaining batter. Makes 3 servings, 2 pancakes each (6 pancakes total).

When the griddle becomes hot, transfer the roti on it. Squeeze off excess water from the muslin cloth and smear water over the roti including the edges with the cloth. Do not pour water on roti. The roti must become moist all over.  By now the roti firms up from the centre. 
Flip the roti to the other side. Repeat dampening and then cover it. 
When the roti is cooked, remove from griddle and rub ½ tsp ghee over it. 
Serve hot with curries or vegetables.

","1.	To begin making the Agathi Keerai Recipe, we will first cook the Agathi Keerai and the Moong Dal.
2.	I am assuming the Moong Dal has been soaking for a couple of hours. When we soak it, it will take less time to get cooked along with the greens. Once soaked, drain the excess water from the dal.
3.	Place the chopped Agathi Keerai and the soaked Moong Dal into the pressure cooker. Add 2 to 3 tablespoons of water, sprinkle some salt and cover the pressure cooker. Place the weight on and pressure cook the greens and the lentils until you hear a couple of whistles. Turn off the heat after a couple of whistles and allow the pressure to release naturally. 
4.	Once the pressure has released naturally, our next step is to season the Agathi Keerai.
5.	Heat oil in a pan, add the mustard seeds, cumin seeds, red chilies, curry leaves, and asafoetida. Allow them to crackle.
6.	Add the steamed Agathi keerai and moong dal, coconut, jaggery, and salt to taste. Stir gently to combine the ingredients for a couple of minutes. Check the salt and spice levels and adjust to suit your taste. Turn off the heat and transfer to a serving bowl and serve.

Make it round and flat in shape from the edges keeping the middle portion thick. Put a generous amount of the stuffing in the middle section of the flat dough and then wrap it from the edges so that all the stuffing should be inside the dough of the paratha. Now make a nice ball shape and sprinkle some flour dust on it and then roll out the dough into a nice flat bread just like roti or Indian bread. Repeat the same. Take a tawa and put it on the flame. Let it hot for some time. Then add the flat bread onto the tawa. Once it is cooked from one side flip it to another side.

In a large bowl add the poha, make sure that the poha that you are using are of the thick variety & they should be old. 
Add water into the bowl & gently wash the poha by mixing them in the water, then immediately strain the poha using a sieve, let the poha rest in the sieve for 8-10 minutes. 
While the poha is resting you can start the further cooking process. 
Set a pan over high flame, once the pan gets hot, add the oil & heat it well. 
Further add cumin seeds, mustard seeds, green chill, curry leaves & peanuts, mix well & cook over low flame briefly & then add the potatoes. 
Cook the potatoes over high flame until they are half cooked, make sure you half cook the potatoes before adding the onions, if you add potatoes & onion together then the onions will get overcooked.
Once the potatoes are half done, add in the chopped onion & sugar, stir well & cook until the onion turns almost light golden brown over high flame. 
When the onion turns almost light golden brown the potatoes will also be cooked perfectly, lower the flame at this stage & add salt & turmeric powder, mix well & add the soaked poha along with fresh coriander & lemon juice, stir everything very gently. 
Further add a splash of water over the poha & cover the pan with a lid, switch off the flame & let the poha rest for 3-4 minutes, following this step will ensure that the poha turns out to be very moist & fluffy due to the steam. 
Remove the lid after 3-4 minutes & sprinkle some freshly chopped coriander.

Quick Soaking 1 hour

Ingredients:
    ▢ 1 pound dry chickpeas, approximately 2 cups dry chickpeas
    ▢ ½ to 1 teaspoon baking soda, depending on the cooking mehtod
    ▢ water
    ▢ Kosher salt
    ▢ 1 to 2 bay leaves
    ▢ 2 garlic cloves, lightly smashed","Instructions:

    Prepare the chickpeas for cooking. Simply look through the beans and discard any rocks or anything that does not look like a chickpea. 

Stovetop Method

    Soak the chickpeas. You can either soak them overnight or try the quick soaking method. To soak overnight, put the chickpeas in a large bowl and add plenty of water to cover the chickpeas by a good 3 inches. Set aside for 24 hours. For the quick soak method, put the chickpeas in a pot and add 6 cups of water. Bring to a boil and cook for 2 minute. Turn the heat off, cover and let the chickpeas soak for 1 hour. Drain.
    In a large cooking pot, put the chickpeas and 1 teaspoon of baking soda. Cook over medium-high heat, tossing constantly for about 3 to 4 minutes. Add 7 cups of water to cover the beans by several inches. Season with a big pinch of kosher salt (about 1 teaspoon or more if you like). Add the bay leaf and garlic. Bring to a boil, then turn the heat down and simmer, skimming off any foam or skins that float to the top. Chickpeas will cook anywhere from 40 minutes to 1 ½ hour or until tender (cooking time will vary depending on the type and freshness of the chickpeas). 

Slow Cooker Method

    In a 2 ½-quart slow cooker, put the chickpeas, ½ teaspoon baking soda, 7 cups water, a big pinch of kosher salt, bay leaf, and garlic. Cover and cook on high heat for 4 hours, or low heat for 6 to 8 hours, or until tender. 

Pressure Cooker Method

    Add the chickpeas and 6 cups of water to the pressure cooker. Seal the lid shut. Select High Pressure and cook for 50 minutes. Allow the pressure cooker to naturally release for 10 minutes, then vent the remaining pressure and when the release valve drops, safely open the lid.

    ▢ ½ teaspoon ground black pepper

    ▢ 4 cups water

For the rice:
    ▢ 3 cups basmati rice
    ▢ 1 teaspoon salt
    ▢ 4.5 cups broth

For the Garnish:
▢ ½ cup slivered almonds
▢ 2 tablespoons olive oil
▢ ½ cup raisins","Instructions
For the meat:

    Start by peeling, washing and dicing the onions.
    Next, in a non-stick pot (or in the instant pot), sauté the onions until soft and lightly brown, for about 7 minutes, on medium heat.
    Next, in the same pot with the onions inside, sear the lamb pieces for a few minutes on each side. Don't worry if the pot is crowded, aim to get some colour on the meat.
    Next, add the whole spices and the ground spices to the pot with the meat and onions and cook for a few minutes.
    Next, add the tomato paste and cook for a few minutes.
    Add the tomato sauce and the water to the pot, and now you have the option to cook the meat on the stove top or the pressure cooker.
    For the pressure cooker (or instant pot), pressure cook for 20 minutes. Manually release the pressure and move on to the next step.
    For the stove top, cook on medium high heat for approximately 60 minutes until the meat is very tender, making sure to replenish the water as required.
    Once the meat is soft, remove it from the broth and place it in a plate to the side. Strain the broth from the onions and whole spices.

For the rice:
    While the meat is cooking, wash the rice until liquid runs clear, then soak it for 30 minutes.
    Layer the meat at the bottom of the pot that you will cook the rice in (this can be the same pot you used for the meat if you cooked it on the stove top).
    Then, pour over the meat broth that you strained, making sure that you use exactly 4.5 cups (for 3 cups of rice). If you don't have enough broth, just top it up with water. If you have too much broth, save it for a future use.
    Place the pot onto high heat for 5 minutes until liquid is bubbling.
    Place a paper towel over the pot, then cover it with a tight-fitting lid and simmer on low heat for 25 minutes.
    After 25 minutes, turn the heat off and fluff it with a fork.
    Toast the almonds on medium heat in the olive oil, stirring frequently until lightly golden. Remove and add the raisins in the same skillet for 1-2 minutes until warmed through.
    Serve in a large platter by adding a layer of the rice and meat, then garnishing with almonds, raisins, and finely chopped parsley if desired.

    1 tbsp powdered garam masala

    3 tbsp ginger-garlic paste

    2 tbsp chilli powder

    6 green chillies","Method:

1. Select a large pot. Heat 4 tablespoons of ghee or olive oil in a pot. Add the garam masala and onions. Stir-fry until golden brown. Remove and set aside for later. Add the mutton pieces to the same pot and stir-fry until well browned and until all the liquid evaporates.

Tip: Cook on a medium-to-low temperature to brown well without the risk of burning the meat.

2. While the meat browns, prepare the biryani mixture by mixing all the ingredients.

3. In a separate pan, boil the rice in plenty of fresh, salted water until half cooked. The rice grains should have lengthened but should not be fully cooked. Drain the rice and set it aside.

4. When the meat is well browned, add the biryani mixture and stir-fry for 1-2 minutes. Add the yoghurt and tomatoes. Let it bubble in the pan to make a fragrant meat curry. Season with salt.

5. To assemble the biryani for cooking: first, spread half of the meat curry in a heatproof casserole. Next, spread over half of the rice as the second layer. Spread the remaining meat curry on top of the rice and finally cover with a layer of the remaining rice. Sprinkle saffron over this rice layer and pour over an additional 5 tablespoons of water.

6. Cover the pot with a tight fitting lid and cook over very gentle heat for about 10 to 15 minutes.

    ▢ 2 tablespoon hot milk
    ▢ ¼ teaspoon green cardamom powder
    ▢ ¼ teaspoon saffron threads","Instructions

    Sift in the flour, salt, and baking powder. It is essential to sift the dry ingredients to prevent any lumps from the baking powder. Keep aside.
    In a small bowl, or a glass, mix the hot milk with cardamom powder and saffron threads. Mix well, cover, and keep aside.
    In a large mixing bowl, add the three large eggs and beat until a little lighter in color, for two minutes.
    Add the sugar to the beaten eggs and beat for three to four minutes.
    Now add the milk and saffron mixture and beat the mixture for a minute.
    Add the flour to the beaten eggs and sugar. Mix until combined.
    Pour the melted butter into the batter and mix until combined. Make sure the melted butter is not hot.
    Cover the batter and refrigerate for 1 hour but best to chill for 2 hours to 12 hours.
    Preheat the oven to 350F/180C for at least 20 minutes before using it.
    Prepare the pan. If you use a regular pan or a nonstick one, it is best to grease and flour it. Tap the pan one time over the working surface or the sink to get rid of excess flour.
    Do not mix the batter after taking it out of the fridge. Using an ice cream scoop or a tablespoon, scoop the batter in the center of the madeleine’s molds. Do not try to spread the batter.
    If using a silicone mold, place it over a baking sheet and then bake it in the oven.
    Bake on the middle shelf for 12 minutes, or until you insert a toothpick in the middle and it comes out clean.

    2 tablespoon cornflour
    ½ cup short grain rice
    1 ½ cups boiling water
    1 teaspoon salt
    2-3 garlic cloves finely chopped
    1 good handful cilantro finely chopped
    4 tablespoon butter
    Pinch of dried mint","Instructions:
To make the kibbeh balls:

    Soak the bulgur wheat in enough water to cover and set aside
    To make the filling, sauté the chopped onions in regular olive oil until golden on medium low heat
    Add 250g of minced meat to the onions and cook out the meat on medium high heat
    Add the 7 spice, kamouneh spices, black pepper and salt and use the back of your wooden spoon to break up the meat
    When it is cooked turn off the heat and add the sumac and pine nuts. Taste to make any adjustments then cover and set aside
    Drain the bulgur wheat and add to a large bowl. Take out the half kilo of meat and prepare the food processor
    In several batches, add the bulgur wheat and equal amounts of meat to the food processor and process until it clumps together and starts to roll in the processor bowl.
    Roughly chop onions to go in the food processor along with the 7 spices, kamouneh spices, black pepper and salt. Blitz well
    When you have combined all the meat and bulgur wheat in a bowl, add the blitzed onion spice mix and the cornflour, then bring everything together preferably with your hands
    If it is too dry add a bit of water, you don’t want it too loose, sticky or crumbly but so it holds together nicely. If you don’t mind tasting a bit of raw meat check a tiny bit for saltiness and adjust as necessary
    Add approx half a cup of sunflower to a small bowl which you can dip your fingers into when shaping the kibbeh to avoid sticking. Clean your table and arrange a workflow with a large clean tray, the sunflower oil, the filling and the casing mix

    Take some casing and roll into golf ball size, indent the middle then hollow out the inside with your index finger turning as you do so until you have a half shell. Add a spoon of filling and close up the casing. Compress well with your hands and shape into classic kibbeh shape

To make the yoghurt sauce :

    Soak the rice in water for about 20 minutes

    Rinse the rice under the tap until the water runs clear. Then add the rice to 1.5 cups of boiling water and simmer until cooked (approx 20 minutes)

    Add the cornflour and salt to the yoghurt, stir well then press through a fine sieve over the rice

    Raise the heat to a medium high and keep stirring so the bottom doesn’t burn, bring to the boil then lower the heat and keep on a low simmer

    Meanwhile, put around ten kibbeh balls into an oven at 180 °C fan and half cook them for about 15 minutes so the outside just turns slightly golden but not well done

    Add the kibbeh to the yoghurt sauce and keep simmering for another ten minutes

    In a separate small pan, sauté the garlic and coriander in the butter for a few minutes then add to the yoghurt sauce along with a pinch of dried mint, stir well and adjust the salt if necessary before turning off the heat

    1.5 tablespoon cornflour
    1 teaspoon 7 spice
    ½ teaspoon black pepper
    1 tablespoon salt
    Sunflower or vegetable oil","Instructions:

    Soak the bulgur wheat in enough water to cover and set aside

    Add 500g of minced meat to the onions and cook out the meat on medium high heat
    Add the 7 spice, kamouneh spices, black pepper and salt and use the back of your wooden spoon to break up the meat
    When it is cooked turn off the heat and add the sumac and chopped walnuts. Taste to make any adjustments then cover and set aside
    Drain the bulgur wheat and add to a large bowl. Take out the kilo of meat and prepare food processor
    In several batches, add the bulgur wheat and equal amounts of meat to the food processor and process until it clumps together and starts to roll in the processor bowl.
    Roughly chop 2 onions to go in the food processor along with the 7 spices, kamouneh spices, black pepper and salt. Blitz well
    When you have combined all the meat and bulgur wheat in a bowl, add the blitzed onion spice mix and the cornflour, then bring everything together preferably with your hands
    If it is too dry add a bit of water, you don't want it too loose, sticky or crumbly but so it holds together nicely. If you don't mind tasting a bit of raw meat check a tiny bit for saltiness and adjust as necessary

    Add approx half a cup of sunflower to a small bowl which you can dip your fingers into when shaping the kibbeh to avoid sticking. Clean your table and arrange a workflow with a large clean tray, the sunflower oil, the filling and the casing mix

    Take some casing and roll into golf ball size, indent the middle then hollow out the inside with your index finger turning as you do so until you have a half shell. Add a spoon of filling and close up the casing. Compress well with your hands and shape into classic kibbeh morsels (see video)

    Line up the kibbeh on the tray until you finish the filling

    ⅓ cup (⅔ ounce) chopped fresh mint (optional but recommended—you can chop it in the food processor with the parsley)
    ⅓ cup thinly sliced green onion
    ⅓ cup extra-virgin olive oil
    3 to 4 tablespoons lemon juice, to taste
    1 medium clove garlic, pressed or minced","Instructions:

    Cook or soak the bulgur until tender according to package directions. Drain off any excess water, and set aside to cool.
    Meanwhile, combine the diced cucumber and tomato in a medium bowl with ½ teaspoon of the salt. Stir, and let the mixture rest for at least 10 minutes, or until you’re ready to mix the salad.
    To prepare the parsley, cut off the thick stems. Then, finely chop the parsley and remaining stems—you can do this by hand, but it’s much easier in a food processor with the standard “S” blade. Process 1 bunch at a time (it should yield about 1 cup chopped), transferring the chopped parsley to a large serving bowl before proceeding with the next.
    Add the cooled bulgur, chopped fresh mint (if using) and green onion to the bowl of parsley. Strain off and discard the cucumber and tomato juice that has accumulated in the bottom of the bowl (this ensures that your tabbouleh isn’t too watery). Add the strained cucumber and tomato to the bowl.
    In a small measuring cup or bowl, whisk together the olive oil, 3 tablespoons lemon juice, garlic, and remaining ½ teaspoon salt. Pour it into the salad and stir to combine. Taste, and adjust if necessary—add another tablespoon of lemon juice for zing, or salt for more overall flavor.

Ingredients:
    ▢ 2 Italian eggplants or small globe eggplants

    ▢ 1 garlic clove, minced
    ▢ 1 tablespoon plain Greek yogurt, optional

    ▢ ¾ teaspoon Aleppo pepper or red pepper flakes, optional
    ▢ Extra virgin olive oil
    ▢ Toasted pine nuts for garnish, optional","Instructions:
    First, smoke or grill the eggplant. Turn one gas burner on medium-high. Place the eggplant directly over the flame. Using a pair of tongs, turn the eggplant every 5 minutes or so until it is tender and the skin is charred and crispy on all sides (20 minutes.) The eggplant should deflate and become super tender. supposed to. If you don't have a gas burner you can use a grill. You can also roast the eggplant in the oven (see notes).
    Remove the eggplant from the heat and transfer it to a large colander over a bowl. Allow it to sit and drain for a few minutes until fully cooled and all excess water has been drained (it helps if you open the eggplant up a bit and push on it with a knife or a spoon to help it release its juices).
    Once the eggplant is cool enough to touch, peel the charred crispy skin off (it should come right off). Discard the skin and the stem (don't worry if a few bits of the skin remain, that is just added flavor).
    Transfer the cooked and fully drained eggplant to a bowl. Use a fork to break it down into smaller pieces. Add the tahini paste, garlic, lemon juice, Greek yogurt (if using) salt, pepper, sumac, Aleppo pepper or crushed red pepper flakes. Mix gently with a wooden spoon or a fork until well-combined.
    Cover the baba ganoush and chill in the fridge for 30 minutes to an hour.
    To serve, transfer the baba ganoush to a rimmed serving dish or a bowl. Top with a good drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and toasted pine nuts, if you like.

    500 g cooked chickpeas (from 200 g dry chickpeas or 2x400 g tins)
    water
    finely chopped flat-leaf parsley, to garnish
    salt and pepper","Instructions:

    Preheat the oven to 230 C (445 F) fan. Line two baking sheets with baking parchment.
    Peel off stripes of the skin of the aubergine so it resembles a zebra pattern, then chop into 1 ½ cm (½ in) cubes. Mix with 100 ml of the olive oil and some salt. Transfer to the two baking sheets and roast until nearly fully (but not quite fully) softened, around 15 minutes. I place the two baking sheets in the middle and high in the oven. Keep an eye on them and swap their places if one cooks faster than the other (ovens vary a lot on this). Set aside.
    Heat a thick-bottomed pot over medium/ low heat. Fry the onion in the remaining 2 Tbsp (30 ml) olive oil until softened, but not coloured, stirring regularly. This usually takes 8-10 minutes. Add the garlic, allspice, cinnamon and a little salt and pepper. Fry for 30 seconds, stirring constantly, then add the tomatoes, sugar and 100 ml water. Mix well, bring to the boil and leave to simmer, covered, for 10-15 minutes to allow the flavours to settle.
    Add the lemon juice, roasted aubergine and cooked chickpeas. Continue to cook, covered, until the aubergine is completely soft, another 10-20 minutes. Taste for seasoning, adding more salt, pepper, sugar or lemon juice to taste.
    Serve warm or at room temperature, garnished with a generous sprinkling of finely chopped flat-leaf parsley.

    In a large bowl combine the yeast, sugar and ½ cup of the warm water. The water should not be too hot or the yeast will not proof. Mix together and set aside for about 10 minutes until foamy. 
    Add the flour, remaining water and salt to the proofed yeast. Using the dough hook of your stand mixer, begin mixing on low speed. Slowly add the oil and increase the speed until fully combined. If the dough is sticky, add more flour, a tablespoon at a time. If you find the dough wont combine, add water, also a tablespoon at a time. The dough can be made without a stand mixer and kneaded by hand.
    Lightly flour the bowl and place the dough ball inside. Cover with a kitchen towel and let rise in a warm area for an hour, until doubled in size. After an hour or so, divide the dough into 12 balls. Recover with towel and let rise for an additional 30-45 minutes. 
    Soak the akawi cheese in a bowl of cold water for at least 30 minutes to let out some the salt.

Dough:

    3 cups All purpose flour
    1 tbsp Milk powder optional
    1 tbsp Granulated Sugar
    1 tsp Salt
    1/3 cup Vegetable oil
    1 cup Water

Filling:

    1/2 lb Ground Beef ground lamb can be used or a mixture of both
    3 tbsp. Pine nuts toasted in olive oil
    1 Small Onion
    Handful of Parsley
    3 Garlic cloves
    1/2 tbsp Smoked Paprika
    1 tbsp Seven spice or allspice
    Salt & pepper to taste

Yogurt Sauce:

    32 oz Plain yogurt do not use greek yogurt.
    1 1/2 tsp Salt
    2 tbsp Corn starch
    2 cups Water may need more

Garnish:

    1 head Garlic crushed
    3 tbsp Dried Mint crushed","Instructions:

    First, prepare the dough by combining all the ingredients together with a kitchenaid with the paddle attachment or by hand. Initially pour the cup of water a little at a time. Cover and let it rest for 30 min as you prepare the filling.
    In a food processor, add the onion, garlic, and parsely from the meat filling and pulse. Add this mixture to the beef and saute in a pan with the seasonings. Cook till browned well. Add toasted pine nuts to the filling as well. Set aside.
    Once the dough is ready, cut the ball in half and roll out each half thinly. About 1 inch thick. Cut small circles into the dough using a cookie cutter or a small coffee cup. Spread out each circle and add 1 tsp of beef filling onto one side of the circle. Shape like an empanada pinching at the seams. Then pinch the ends of the dumpling together or overlap them to look like tortellini. Repeat this step until all the dough is done.
    Place the dumplings onto a nonstick pan sprayed with olive oil. Bake in a 400 F oven for about 10 minutes until lightly browned. Feel free to broil for a minute for more color.
    At this point, once the dumplings are cooled you can place them in a ziplock and freeze them for another meal.
    Let's work on the yogurt sauce. Add the yogurt, corn starch, salt, and water to a blender.
    Add this mixture to a pot and place on medium heat. Keep mixing until the sauce starts to thicken about 10-15 min until it boils. If you want it thickened more, add a ladle of the yogurt sauce into a bowl and add more corn starch to it and stir. Place back into the pot to thicken it. I like my yogurt thick enough to coat a spoon.
    Once at the consistency you prefer, add the dumplings and cook for 10 minutes together. They should be floating to thr top.
    In a pan, saute the garlic in olive oil until crisp. Add this to the yogurt sauce and garnish with dried mint as well.
